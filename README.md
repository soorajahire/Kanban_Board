# Kanban_Board

A Kanban board is one of the tools that can be used to implement Kanban to manage work at a personal or organizational level.

Kanban boards visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process

Simple boards have columns for "waiting", "in progress" and "completed" or "to-do", "doing", and "done"
